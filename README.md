* Copying the source files from a website to upload to pinata to tie to NFT domain.

# Successful copying of website source to upload to IPFS and host for free with a .crypto domain (also bought and paid for)

# Steps to recreate (with your own domain):
- Open Pinata and set up account.
- Ensure you have the source files downloaded locally so you can upload them through pinata and get the IPFS hash
- Create Unstoppable domains account and navigate to the domains management. Upload your content and that's it!
- Make sure you have the Unstoppable browser extension installed so that you can resolve the domain in either Chrome or Brave. Native support on Opera browswer without extension

# Verify you are on the correct site by using this domain only! *Bytebuilder.crypto

- This site is the landing page for bytebuilder, an independent enterprise to teach non-technical individuals how to build and operate a mining computer. The information here is not investment advice, rather it is a general guide on how to access the crypto space through mining and ideas of where you can invest. 

- The site contains good places to access exchanges, wallets and mining materials. 

- There is an instructional course attached to this site which I created to document and demonstrate the process of building and operating a mining computer. This is for instructional purposes in the technical construction and operation of the mining computer, designed for beginners with no technical knowledge. 

- The course is also hosted on Udemy!
