- This site is the landing page for bytebuilder, an independent enterprise to teach non-technical individuals how to build and operate a mining computer. The information here is not investment advice, rather it is a general guide on how to access the crypto space through mining and ideas of where you can invest. 

- The site contains good places to access exchanges, wallets and mining materials. 

- There is an instructional course attached to this site which I created to document and demonstrate the process of building and operating a mining computer. This is for instructional purposes in the technical construction and operation of the mining computer, designed for beginners with no technical knowledge. 

- The course is also hosted on Udemy!
